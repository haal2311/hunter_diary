# Notes
1. It's not a question of if incident, but when incident and how quickly can you detect and respond.
2. Prevention is a goal, detection and response is the reality.
3. Incident response refers to the technical aspects dealing with the incident, while incident handling refears to non-technical aspecs.
4. Internal visibility is key for responding to incidents.
5. 


# Malware Cases
1. The initial infection vector (how the malware got on the system).
2. The propagation mechanism (how the malware moves between systems, if it does that).
3. The persistence mechanism (how the malware remains on the system, and survives reboots and when the user logs out).
4. Artifacts (what traces the malware leaves on a system as a result of its execution) that you can look for during an examination.
